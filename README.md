•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  In this project, we have a hypothetical “corner grocer” that needs a program to analyze text document records they generate throughout the day. The records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They would like to know how often items are purchased to better rearrange and display their products. They wanted the following three requirements met:
  
 -Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
 -Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
 -Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.
  
  To do this we used C++ to develop a menu that displays and asks the user what they would like to do, offering 3 options and a 4th to exit the program. Then we were to create code to determine the number of times each item appears in the text file document and display each item and its number of purchases.
After, we created code to determine the frequency of specific items in the document to give the user the opportunity to search for a specific item. Finally, we created code to display a histogram based on the number of purchases for all items.

•	What did you do particularly well?
  Despite having very little experience with C++ and Python individually I found it fairly simple to use both languages and incorporate the two together to create a multi-language program.
  

•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  There are many ways to enhance code, practice is the best way to become familiar with industry standard and code quality, continuously learning to improve quality, security, using descriptive comments. 
  
•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging pieces of code were determining what to incorporate to manipulate the file into a new file and what will be done in C++ and what will be done in Python. In order to overcome this, I went over our reading material thoroughly, went over the assignment requirements thoroughly, and spent a lot of time researching Python and C++.
  
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Learning to realize the strengths and weaknesses of different languages and how to use the strengths of multiple languages together will certainly be a useful skill moving forward.
  
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Using proper indentation, descriptive commenting, and simplicity.
